					There is a lot to say about this guy.He is one of the best pubg player i have ever seen. He goes right where the enemies are and gets knocked down.That's his special talont.By doing so he tells us where the enemies are and we get there trying to save him and then, one by one we all get knocked and finally RIP in peace.<br> But, there is one thing he makes sure before becoming a wooden crate and that is he never leaves the opponent disappointed.He loots like a "Bhuka sher" or a "fakir" to be precise(#beingModest:D). He believes in "jhola uthake chal padenge" but the jhola must be fully filled with loot items. Thus giving the opponent a kill and a lot of loot.Such a "Bade dil wala".<br> Will be uploading his inexplicable gameplays which will chill you to the bones. STAY TUNED!<br>
